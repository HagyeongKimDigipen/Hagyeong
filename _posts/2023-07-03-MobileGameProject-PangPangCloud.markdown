description: Cloud Pang Pang is a mobile Android game created using Unity. In this game, players can control an airplane by tilting their mobile phones. They need to avoid attacks from enemy planes and survive as long as possible. Additionally, if the player gets a certain number of clouds for each color, they can get bombs, extra lives and they can trigger a fiver time <br/> This project was developed using C# and implemented with the Unity engine. It was a 2-person team project, and I was responsible for creating the score system, generating and vanishing clouds, airplane movement, fever time, and game options. <br/> The main goal of this project was to learn Unity, as it was my first mobile project. Despite being a relatively simple game project, it was immensely helpful in learning Unity. Since it was a project undertaken by just two people, we had to work together to address many aspects, which helped enhance our ability to utilize Unity effectively.
