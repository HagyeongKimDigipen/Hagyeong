description: This project is a basic graphics engine using OpenGL. It is a solol project made using C++ and OpenGL and GLSL. <br/> This is a graphic engine project that I made using OpenGL for the first time. Includes simple, basic graphics engine functionality.  <br/> - Keyboard and mouse Input <br/> - Window creation and control <br/> - Rendering 50 Objects <br/> - Catmull - Rom Spline <br/> - Back Face Curling <br/> This graphics engine project encompasses very basic functionalities, but it's a project of great significance to me because it's the first project I've created on my own using OpenGL. Integrating the features I implemented one by one into a unified engine allowed me to enhance my skills in combining and integrating diverse pieces of code. Through this project, I was able to render what I desired using the OpenGL graphics API and create a complete engine, which brought me a sense of accomplishment and pride.
