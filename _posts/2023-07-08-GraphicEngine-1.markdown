description: This project is a Graphics engine that includes lighting. It is a solo project created using C++, OpenGL, ImGui and GLSL <br/> At first, I created a basic graphics engine for this project that involved loading objects and mapping textures and then I developed shaders capable of Phong Lighting, Phong Shading, and Blinn shading <br/> In addition, I have added lights that extend up to 16 and allow the user to set individual values for these lights, and the possible values are the items below. <br/> - Choose the type of light among Point Light, Directional Light, and Spot Light <br/> - Inner and outer angle for spot light <br/> - Spot falloff <br/> Furthermore, there are the following values as user-configurable global values <br/> - Ambient, diffuse and specular color <br/> - attenuation coefficients <br/> - atmospherc(fog) color <br/> - Global ambient color <br/> Also, when mapping textures, users can change the color of material coefficients, and I have provided the option to separately set calculations on the CPU and GPU. <br/> Since it was a graphic engine that I had to create on my own, there were many challenges, but I tackled each problem step by step.
