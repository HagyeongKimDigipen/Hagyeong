description: Pang Pang Dust is a 2D platformer shooting game where players use a vacuum cleaner to catch up fine dust particles, attack and purify ultrafine dust, and run to the finish line Players can move using the keyboard, shoot using the mouse, and enjoy the game using various items. <br/> This project was developed in C++ and implemented using a custom engine created by the professor, not a commercial engine. As the team's producer, I oversaw the members and was responsible for the game's health system, spawning dust, and character movement. I also handled the game's scoring system, map design, and created the shooting gauge. <br/> Since this was my first direct experience in creating a game, there were many shortcomings and challenges. However, I was able to learn about the skills required for game development and gain insights by collaborating with team members and working together harmoniously. Despite its shortcomings, this project provided a foundation for game development and allowed me to build a solid understanding of game projects.
