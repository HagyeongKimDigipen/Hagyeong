description: This project is a graphic engine that implements Environment Mapping including Reflection and Refraction. It's a solo project created using C++, OpenGL, Im Gui, and GLSL. <br> The graphic engine includes basic functions such as loading objects and mapping textures. Additionally, I've incorporated features like cube mapping for the skybox, scene rendering using FBO, and shaders capable of Environment Mapping. <br> Environment Mapping includes the following elements <br>  - Only reflection <br> - Only refraction <br> - Combination of both <br> Also, I made Phong shading and Environment mapping work at the same time. <br> It is a graphics engine that implements environmental mapping based on the graphic engine that was created first. Throughout the process, there were numerous revisions to the engine itself and I spent a lot of time trying to implement many things at once, and the process of building the engine wasn't smooth. Nevertheless, this project allowed for a deep understanding of graphics engines and provided the opportunity to derive enjoyment from development.
