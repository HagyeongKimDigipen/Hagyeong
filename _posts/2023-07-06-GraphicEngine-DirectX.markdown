description: This project is a basic Graphics engine developed using DirectX. It's a solo project created with C++, DirectX, and GLSL. <br> This graphics engine project was initiated to learn and apply DirectX. It encompasses simple and fundamental graphics engine functionalities. <br> - Keyboard and mouse Input <br> - Window creation and control <br> - Create simple shapes <br> - Model transform (rotation, translation) <br> - Implementation Math Library <br> This graphics engine project includes very basic functionalities, but it was initiated to learn a new graphics API called DirectX, which I wasn't familiar with as I usually used OpenGL. DirectX was completely new to me, and I had never studied it before, so there were many challenges from the beginning. However, through this project, I gained the joy of challenging myself with something new and the courage to face any new program or API, knowing that I can learn and improve even when encountering unfamiliar territory.
