description: Release From Perdition is a 3D first-person shooter game that features a journey to defeat numerous monsters with shooting and special abilities and find missing team members. Players can move to the keyboard, use the mouse to change weapons and shoot, and use the special ability to change positions and spawn shadows that have the ability to explode. <br> This project was developed using Unreal Engine 4 and C++. As the team's gameplay programmer, I was responsible for player movement, monster spawning, and implementing monster spawn effects and health. Additionally, I collaborated with the team member responsible for creating monsters to enhance the AI behavior of the monsters. <br> Since this was my first experience with Unreal Engine, I faced many challenges due to my limited understanding of the engine. However, I made efforts to quickly familiarize myself with Unreal Engine by researching various resources. Moreover, as there weren't many available resources, I focused on self-solving problems as much as possible. <br> Especially as the person responsible for the spawn system, which had to manage multiple monsters created by different team members, I encountered some difficulties. Therefore, I implemented the spawn system that could track the number of live monsters in the field, allowing game designers to easily set the type, quantity, and respawn frequency of monsters when creating maps. <br> Collaborating with team members from different backgrounds in terms of race, age, and majors, I was able to learn about the process of creating a game. Our team held weekly meetings to share difficulties and solve problems together. Through sharing ideas and constantly pondering how to improve the game in a better direction, I learned a lot during this project.
