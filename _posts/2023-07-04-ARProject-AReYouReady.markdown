description: Are You Ready is an Android AR project created using Unity. This project includes three types of simulations. <br/> - A bowling simulation using GPS <br/> - An AR business card using image tracking <br/> - A color-changing game using Photon Networking <br/> This project was built with C# and implemented using Unity engine, AR Foundation, and photon. This project is a two-person team project, and I created a feature that allows users to find the ideal plane, place objects, and change the size and location of objects. In addition, I take users's location and allow users to spawn the appropriate objects that correspond to location. Additionally, my team used Photon to synchronize the location and properties of objects and planes between users so that the game can proceed. <br/> This is the first AR project that I conducted to study and utilize new technologies. It was a two-person project, but we were able to create various simulations using Image tracking and Photon beyond simple AR projects to utilize various technologies. I had a lot of problems because it was my first time learning AR, and I even do not have a lot of data, but I was able to develop my problem-solving skills by trying to solve problems with my team members.
