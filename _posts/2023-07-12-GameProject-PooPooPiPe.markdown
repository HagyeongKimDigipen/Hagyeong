description: PooPooPiPe is 2D puzzle game that connect to pipes from start to end so that the main character, Poo, Players can use the mouse to drag and move pipe puzzle pieces, and click to rotates the direction of the pipes. Once the pipe puzzle is completed, Poo moves to the destination, advancing to the next stage.<br/> This project was developed in C++ and implemented with a self-made engine. As the producer of the team, I oversaw the overall process of the project, implemented the game engine, and created most of the game stages and elements.<br/>When I made my own game engine, I faced difficulties due to the lack of specific information, but by researching various resources and reading books on game design, I was able to create the engine.  Since our team needed to develop the game quickly, time for creating the engine was limited, which made it challenging, but it was also a valuable learning experience to create an engine from the ground up.<br/>Furthermore, during the project, there were conflicts between team members due to one team member not completing tasks on time. However, as the producer, I conducted meetings to reconcile the team and personally helped the team member with assigned tasks to resolve the conflict.<br/>It was my first project to make my own engine, so I had a lot of difficulties while making it, and I ran out of time, but the completed game reflects our team's unique style, and it was good to make everything myself from the beginning to the end of the game. Moreover, successfully wrapping up this project as a complete game made it a meaningful endeavor.
