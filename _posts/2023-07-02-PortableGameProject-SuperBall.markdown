description: Super Ball is a Nintendo game project created using Unity. Players can throw bowling balls using Nintendo's Joycon, and they have to knock down pins and get score. <br/> The project was built with C# and implemented with the Unity engine.  Also, it is a three-person team project and this project was carried out using the Nintendo development kit. <br/> Due to the short timeframe and the learning process of Nintendo development, this project has a relatively simple game structure. However, my team has added the ability to directly recognize the joycon and throw the ball by calculating the angle at which the player is holding the joycon and the speed at which the player moved the joycon. <br/> It was a meaningful time to develop Nintendo game myself. It was very difficult to get the Joycon's movement input and make it respond in real time, but I was proud to get good results. In particular, this project was very difficult because it couldn't find any resource on the Internet at all, and it had to be helped by a given example code. In addition, time was very tight due to time and space constraints, but I was able to solve problems by constantly trying and meeting with the members.
