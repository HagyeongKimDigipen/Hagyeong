description: This project is about implementing the basic structure of a game engine. In addition to the engine, there are two simple 2D games included. One is a platformer game where players avoid obstacles and runs to the finish line, and the other is a shooting game where the players move a spaceship and destroy obstacles. <br><br> This project was developed in C++ and is aimed at providing a fundamental understanding of creating a game engine and implementing simple games using the created engine. Since it was a solo project, I created everything from scratch, but the graphics engine used for implementing the simple games was provided by the professor. <br><br> From features like debugging output, engine loop, FPS, components, connecting stages, and more, I personally implemented the basic functionalities that are typically included in a game engine. In the simple games created using this engine, I implemented character movement, basic AABB collision detection, shooting mechanics, Parallax scrolling background, and Wrapping â€“ fundamental techniques commonly used in games. <br><br> It is a project where I was able to learn the structure and basic functions of the game engine. I had a very difficult experience working on the project without basic knowledge of the game engine, so I thought it would have been nice if I had done this project before working on it. It was a project to lay the foundation for the game engine again.
